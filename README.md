# Locu + Node = `<3`

Want to play with the [Locu API](http://dev.locu.com)? Awesome!
Want to do it with node.js? Even more awesome! Here's a little

help you get going right away.

# Installation

Either clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com:Locu-Unofficial/locu-node.git`)
or install it with the Node Package Manager (`npm install locu`)
